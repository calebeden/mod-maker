# MrCraftable's Player Heads
My Minecraft Bedrock add-on that adds microblocks and mob heads to the game
## How to download and add to Minecraft
1. Inside this repository, there are two directories: Microblocks Addon and Mob Heads Addon. The packs are designed to function either together or separately, depending on what you want to play with. Open the folder of your choosing, locate the .mcaddon file, and download it.
2. Open the file in Minecraft. After a few seconds, you should see the in-game notification saying that the import has started and then a confirmation once it is finished importing the behavior and the resource pack. After this has occurred, you are able to repeat steps 1-2 for the other addon or continue on to add it to your world.
3. Either create a new world or edit an existing one. Add either the resource pack to the world, and it will automatically add the behavior pack, or vice-versa. Be sure that the Holiday Creator Features experiment is turned on. Then, you can load up the world and start using the add-on(s)!
4. Currently, both packs only support creative mode, as the heads do not currently drop from mobs, nor has the wandering trader gained any of the head trades yet. Check back soon for when these features are added.
