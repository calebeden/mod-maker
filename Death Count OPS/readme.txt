It does not let you fly through blocks.
To fly, you must enable Education Edition Features on your world. Instructions here: (https://youtu.be/Wu79wSllCkc)

  + Drink a water bottle whilst in camera mode to follow look at the closest other player
  + Eat a chorus fruit whilst in camera mode to teleport to the closest player

  + Teleport and Follow Look functions do not work due to bugs with add-ons running on servers.



# Adding this pack to your world.
----------------------------------
Download the pack from http://foxynotail.com

# Single Player Worlds and Realms
Use the in game settings to add the behaviour pack to your world. 
To get the pack into the game on windows 10, double click the .mcpack file you downloaded. It should install into Minecraft on it's own.
For other platforms, if trying to open the .mcpack file doesn't work, copy the .mcpack file into the behaviour_packs folder of your Minecraft bedrock installation.

# BDS Servers
Follow the instructions in the launch video here: https://youtu.be/Wu79wSllCkc

# Making the pack work
-----------------------
One player sleep will work for all players.

To enable camera mode, you need to give players the "trusted" tag.
Use the command: /tag playername add trusted

The player will need to be online to have the tag added.
On servers you can run this command from the server console without having to be online, however the tagged player will need to be online.

Once a player is "trusted" they can activate the camera functions as detailed above.



# That's it!

Don't forget to hit F1 to clear your HUD in game and remove any items from your hands so that you won't be seen by the other players!
